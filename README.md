# Tab Status Extension

> Have you ever wanted to put an emoji in front of a tab title when you're sifting through a bunch of apartments, old NES games,
or twenty articles to fix that pesky bug in your code? Well, our searching habits may be different, but I wrote a cool extension to do just that!

##### Here's the lowdown:

 - Use a preset emoji.
 - Provide endless amounts of your own under the *user* tab.
 - Right-click any of the symbols you included and click the *delete* option to delete them
 - If you set example.com to have üëç in the tab, next time you browse there, you can click on the extension and it will populate the üëç in the title
 - The *Remove Status* button will remove the emoji from the current tab for posterity
 - *Clear Storage* Clears all statuses and any user-provided symbols
